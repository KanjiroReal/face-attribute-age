# Face Attribute Analysis Project

This repository is part of a face attribute analysis project I worked on during my internship at a company. The project aims to analyze facial features and information specific to Vietnamese individuals, extracted from IP camera footage. My role focused on Age Estimation or Age Range Classification.

Please note that this code is from an incomplete project, and therefore, no demo is available. Additionally, since this is older code, the structure and organization may be a bit messy.
